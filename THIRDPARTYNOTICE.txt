JS Foundation
Intellectual Property Policy
The JS Foundation supports numerous individual projects (each, a “Project” and together, the “Projects”). Contributions to individual projects are made pursuant to the license applicable to each such Project (with respect to each Project, the “Applicable License”). The Applicable License for each Project with respect to contributions of code will be the Apache License, Version 2.0 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), unless an alternative inbound or outbound license is requested by the technical governing body of a Project and approved by the Board of Directors of the JS Foundation (the “Board”). Any such alternative license will be reflected in the license file for the applicable Project.
The JS Foundation and its Projects seek to integrate and contribute back to other open source projects within the scope of driving widespread adoption and continued development of key JavaScript solutions and related technologies. Based on this design goal for the JS Foundation, the development community will:
• conform to all license requirements of the open source projects leveraged within the project; and
• operate to maximize opportunities for compatibility with other projects that might be leveraged in the project.
Except as may be approved by the Board:
• All new code contributions to any Project shall be made under the Applicable License accompanied by either a JS Foundation CLA Signature available at https://js.foundation/CLA or a Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO, available at http://developercertificate.org/).
• All outbound code will be made available under the Applicable License.
• All documentation (including without limitation code that is intended as sample code) will be contributed to the Project and made available under the Applicable License or, if approved by the Project, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License or under CC0.
Furthermore, on notice to the Projects, the Board may adopt and/or modify contribution policies for the contribution of code to any Project.
The technical governing body of each Project may provide for additional requirements with respect to contributions.
Except for (a) each member’s commitment to be bound by this Policy with respect to its or its employees’ authorized contributions to any Project and (b) any applicable contributor license
agreement, if any, no license is granted by the member to its intellectual property, and none shall be implied by general membership in the JS Foundation.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
